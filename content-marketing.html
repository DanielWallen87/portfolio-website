    <h2>The Story of My Past Life as a Professional Writer</h2>
    <p>I made a living as a writer and content marketer for several years. This is important to know, as you'll discover a huge gap between employers on a background check, and it's because I was serving many different clients as a freelancer. While I can't name most of those clients due to NDA's, I <em>can</em> share work samples written under my own name. It all began when I got picked up as a contributor at <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/author/daniel-wallen" target="_blank">LifeHack</a>.</p>
