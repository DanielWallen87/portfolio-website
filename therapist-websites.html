        <h1>Grow Your Private Practice in 2021 with a Tasteful Website for Therapists</h1>
        <h2>Get more clients and help them overcome mental illness without adding stress to your life.</h2>
        <h3>Meet Daniel Wallen, web designer specializing in therapist and counselor websites. ðŸ‘‡</h3>
        <p class="center mobile">Hard to see? Turn your phone sideways.</p><br><br>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n7Or7Lfy7g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <p class="center">
            <strong>COVID-19 made in-person therapy and counseling difficult. Let's address that.</strong><br><br>
            Are you ready to move your mental health practice online?<br><br>
            Do you need a web design expert to make your daily life simple?<br><br>
            Would you like a website that attracts new clients (no pressure required)?<br><br>
            If your inner voice whispered: "Yes," this video is for you. Watch before you scroll...<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="below-video">Every therapist and counselor website includes:</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Emotional buttons that relate with your target market.</strong><br><br>
            "Learn More" doesn't say much. "Yes, I Want to Defeat Depression" is better. Don't you agree?<br><br>

            <strong>2. Friendly welcome message that emphasizes your specialty.</strong><br><br>
            Family therapy? Counselor for children? Cognitive behavioral therapist? We'll make your specialty crystal clear.<br><br>

            <strong>3. Thoughtful report that shows people how to be mentally healthy.</strong><br><br>
            Trust is hard. Some people need time. For them, we'll create a great resource that makes them feel connected to you.<br><br>

            <strong>4. Moving content that speaks to the needs of your audience.</strong><br><br>
            Clients expect you to understand them on a deep level. Together, we'll create content that shows them you "get it."<br><br>
            
            <strong>5. Precise descriptions that highlight your services.</strong><br><br>
            How are you different from other counselors? Why is your therapy ideal for a certain person? We'll spell it out.<br><br>

            <strong>6. Elegant web design that is accessible for all.</strong><br><br>
            Some people can't see well. Others can't see at all. They must be considered. Accessibility is a big deal.<br><br>

            <strong>7. Reliable processes that attract clients.</strong><br><br>
            We'll use a combination of community outreach and Facebook ads to reach people who need your help.<br><br>  
            
        </p>

        <h3 id="below-video">Do you want a therapy or counseling website that reflects your authentic personality?</h3>
        <p>Click "Discovery Call" and we'll talk about it soon.</p><br><br>

        <!-- <div class="faq">
            <button type="button" class="faq-button">What technologies do you use?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Websites are built and hosted with Webflow. We'll get a domain that fits your needs on Google Domains. Results are measured in Google Analytics. We'll adjust based on data.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Do you offer WordPress websites?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">No. WordPress websites are hard to optimize and easy to hack. 90% of websites that get hacked live on WP. More than 70% of WP themes are vulnerable to security breaches.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Why is Webflow a better choice?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Webflow's more secure and flexible. WordPress forces you to use pre-made themes, which are near impossible to customize. Webflow lets you start with a blank slate, so it's easier to optimize for your goals.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Will you build a website I can maintain?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">That's not ideal. Most people aren't qualified to manage their website. In the past, I was one of them. My website got hacked so hard I couldn't use it anymore. Want to take that risk? Fine. But I won't be a party to it.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">How is this web design service different from others?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Most web designers build your website. I build, launch, promote, optimize, and monetize your website. I also take care of boring stuff related to security and routine maintenance.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Who is a good fit for conversion optimized websites?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Service providers who work in fitness, pet care, or mental health. I can help other service businesses, but am focused on those niches for now.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Who isn't a good fit for conversion optimized websites?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">If you're not willing to engage with people on social media, this offer isn't for you. Community outreach is a huge part of the process.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Are consultations done via phone or Zoom?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Either is okay. We'll go with your preference. Scroll up and book an appointment now.</p>
