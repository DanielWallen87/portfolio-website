        <h1>The Most Interesting and Well-Rounded Web Designer You'll Ever Meet</h1>
        <h2 class="center">Dogfather.<br>Fitness Buff.<br>Mental Health Advocate.</h2>
        <img class="top-img" src="images/website-designer-daniel-wallen.jpg" alt="Daniel Wallen" />
        <p class="mobile-alert">Image too small? Turn your phone sideways (ditto for the others).</p>
        <h2>Sounds like one heck of a claim. Allow me to prove it with a list:</h2>
        <p>
            1. In my past life, I was a certified personal trainer and yoga teacher.<br><br>
            2. Three years ago, I had a manic episode that drove me crazy (literally).<br><br>
            3. Today, I'm writing a memoir about how I overcame this mental health crisis.<br><br>
            4. Walking dogs at the local shelter was the biggest asset to my healing process.<br><br>
            5. I got so good at advertising shelter dogs online that I've found homes for 150+.<br><br>
            6. Cats hiss when I try to walk them; but I made a pet adoption website, which gets them adopted, too.<br><br>
            7. My favorite author (Dean Koontz) answered a letter I wrote. Another favorite (Jenny Lawson) follows me on Twitter.<br><br>
            8. Batman is my inner avatar. I find superhero stories more helpful than any self-help book. You get to see heroism personified.<br><br>
            9. I've written five best-selling Amazon books and hundreds of articles on every subject imaginable (many hit page one of Google).<br><br>
            10. The guy who played Michael Myers met me for breakfast in high school and signed my Halloween comic. He is a pleasant dude.<br><br>
        </p>
        <img src="images/websites-by-daniel-wallen.jpg" alt="Evidence of the claims above: letter signed by Dean Koontz, Halloween comic signed by Dick Warlock, and a screenshot reflecting Jenny Lawson a.k.a. 'The Bloggess' indeed follows Daniel Wallen on Twitter" />
        <h2>What led you to shift gears and become a web designer?</h2>
        <p>
            After the previously mentioned mental health challenge, I was depressed. So depressed it became impossible to write.<br><br>
            I was in a bad place mentally and couldn't escape the question: "Who are you to give advice while your life is such a mess?"<br><br>
            The lack of inspiration caused me to abandon the idea of writing for a bit. But I had to make money somehow, so I got a waiter job.<br><br>
            Sounds awful, but an easy job is exactly what I needed at the time. And it paid better than expected. I made enough money to take a gap year.<br><br> 
            Web design felt like a good bet, because it complements my existing skill set of copywriting and search engine optimization (SEO).<br><br>
            In other words, I can single-handedly perform the holy trinity of online business growth. I'm basically a One Man Agency.<br><br>
            Plus I'm a pro at community outreach. How else do you think I got over a hundred dogs adopted? It wasn't luck.<br><br>
        </p>
        <img src="images/web-design-by-daniel-wallen.jpg" alt="Three shelter dog status which reached 200, 300, and 400 shares on Daniel Wallen's Facebook"/>
        <h2>What makes you different and better than most web designers?</h2>
        <p>
            The average web designer builds your website and... that's it. You have to figure out the rest alone.<br><br>
            Have you studied sales, social media, and online marketing for thousands of hours? Somehow I doubt it.<br><br>
            Without those skills, the most beautiful website ever designed won't do you any good (sorry to inform you).<br><br>
            I'm the only web designer in the galaxy who builds, launches, promotes, optimizes, and monetizes your website.<br><br>
            Here's the traffic from <a href="https://www.tripets.org" target="_blank">Tri Pets</a> (pet adoption website). Bear in mind I only spend two hours per week on this project.<br><br>
            Last time I checked, social shares were over 4,000. Every time I share a link, the shelter receives DM's about pets in an instant.<br><br>
            If we design a website for your small business, I know we'll invest a LOT more time and energy into the process (food for thought).<br><br> 
        </p>
        <img src="images/website-design-by-daniel-wallen.jpg" alt="Google Analytics screenshot reflecting nearly 20,000 visitors for Tri Pets" />
        <h2>What qualities do you find important in a great website?</h2>
        <p>
            Website speed is a big deal. If it takes forever to load, people will leave before you're able to make your case.<br><br>
            The next image reveals how fast my websites are, according to a site speed report from Google. They all earn an A+.<br><br>
            Mobile friendliness is important. Half of your potential clients are on a smartphone (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/smartphones-72percent-of-people-will-use-only-mobile-for-internet-by-2025.html" target="_blank">source</a>). If it looks bad, they'll hate it and leave.<br><br>
            80% of the people who visit my pet adoption website and mental health blog are using a cellphone. Thus, I focus on their needs first.<br><br>
            Security matters. This is why I don't use WordPress. 90% of blogs that get hacked live on WordPress (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wordpress-accounted-for-90-percent-of-all-hacked-cms-sites-in-2018/" target="_blank">source</a>). Their websites are bloated and slow, too.<br><br>
            WordPress forces you to use pre-made themes that are near impossible to customize. They contain a bunch of code you don't want or need. It's poor software.<br><br>
            Webflow is better, because their websites are more secure. You can also start with a blank slate, which makes it much easier to optimize for your business objectives.<br><br>
            In the past, I managed several WordPress websites for clients, and saw how easily they become compromised. One website got hacked so hard we couldn't use it anymore.<br><br>
            This happened despite precautions such as using unique passwords and changing them often. This has never happened on Webflow (and I've built many websites there).

        <h2>Who is a good fit for your website design services?</h2>
        <p>
            I feel led to assist small businesses who are hurting because of the pandemic.<br><br>
            For now, I'm focused on the top three industries I know best: fitness, pet care, and mental health.<br><br>
            Read: I already speak the language of potential clients and customers in those niches. It qualifies as Easy Mode.<br><br>
            This is a good place to mention a fun fact: I've served as a ghostwriter for celebrities featured on popular TV shows.<br><br>
            Specifically, news and talk shows including: 20/20, Today, Inside Edition, Rachael Ray, Steve Harvey, and Anderson Cooper.<br><br>
            I've also acted in 20+ plays, three short films, and a full-length movie titled: "Before the Fall," which was a huge hit in film festivals.<br><br>
            Ghostwriting and acting require you to portray a character who isn't the same as you. In other words, I can write in your distinct voice.<br><br> 
            Your website and associated content will fit your authentic personality. It will feel genuine to your friends, family, and future customers.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>What's included with your small business websites?</h2>
        <p>
            First, we'll have a deep discussion about how your product or service works and who would benefit from it.<br><br>
            A clear understanding of how your audience thinks is essential. This influences every website design decision.<br><br>
            Second, we'll build a simple but effective website that's optimized for conversions (read: every detail is in one place).<br><br>
            The more pages people have to navigate, the lower your conversion rate. Complexity is your enemy. I need you to embrace simplicity.<br><br>
            Third, we'll automate the process of scheduling appointments. There's no need for back-and-forth communication. Again, we like simple!<br><br>
            Resources like Calendly allow you to embed an online calendar into your website. We'll combine this with a personable video to close the deal.<br><br>
            Fourth, we'll monetize your website with Facebook ads that are targeted to your demographics. You'll get new customers... predictably and efficiently.<br><br>
            In comparison to TV and radio commercials, Facebook ads are cost effective. We can test for a few bucks at a time. No big spending until you're 100% optimized.<br><br>  
            At this time, I'm only accepting clients who provide a pet product or service. In the future, I'll open the door for therapists and fitness professionals.<br><br> 
            If you'd like to be notified when those websites are available, send a DM on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/WebWallen" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/webwallen" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. I'll follow-up at my earliest convenience.<br><br>
