            What Internet Architects Do

        <h2>A's to the Q's That Are on Your Mind</h2>
        <img src="images/internet_architect.jpg" />
        <h3>You read the <a href="https://danielwallen.dev/internet-architect.html" target="_blank">Internet Architect</a> page. But you have questions. I'll answer them.</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Who is a good fit for this service?</strong><br><br>

            If you don't already have a product or service, I can't help you.<br><br>

            I'm an Internet Architect. Not a miracle worker. You also need a budget.<br><br>

            How much money? It depends on your exact needs and goals. I'm not a psychic either.<br><br>

            To keep it simple: if you can't afford to invest at least $1,000 in your business, stop reading now.<br><br>

            That said, Client Attraction Towers (CATs) are perfect for service providers. I'm best equipped to help:<br><br>

            Pet sitters<br>
            Dog walkers<br>
            Dog trainers<br>
            Pet groomers<br><br>

            Yoga teachers<br>
            Online coaches<br>
            Personal trainers<br>
            Group exercise instructors<br><br>

            Therapists<br>
            Counselors<br>
            Psychiatrists<br>
            Psychologists<br><br>


            Why those specific types of people? I'm great at writing content about pets, fitness, and mental health.<br><br>

            Read: I know those topics well and have a firm understanding of what resonates with readers who are interested in that stuff.<br><br>

            If you run a different type of appointment-based business, we can talk. But be aware the cost will be higher due to extra research.<br><br>

            <strong>Why is this different from working with a web designer?</strong><br><br>

            Most web designers build the website. And that's it. You won't even get a script for your home or about page.<br><br>

            That's totally fine. Most people are specialists. I'd rather be a generalist. It allows me to solve a wider range of problems.<br><br>

            If you work with me, I'll design your website *and* supply copy that converts. Then we'll find repatable ways to promote it online.<br><br>

            You can't just launch a website and expect people to find it. That's not how the world works. We've gotta direct people to your online home.<br><br>

            Important: you must be willing to get involved in online communities. Facebook groups especially. If you're not willing to do that, it's a bad fit.<br><br>

            <strong>What code tools and programming languages do you use?</strong><br><br>

            This website is built with HTML and CSS. And I know JavaScript, but doubt we'll need it.<br><br>

            I'm also good at building websites with Webflow. To see a sample, look at this <a href="https://tripets.org" target="_blank">pet adoption website</a>.<br><br>
            
            These are your two options. We'd select the one that's most appropriate for your individual preferences.<br><br>

            If you desire customization and are open to signing a monthly retainer, hard coded HTML and CSS might be the ideal solution.<br><br>

            If you want to regularly update the content yourself and are okay with using a template to build upon, Webflow might make more sense.<br><br>

            At the moment, I don't offer WordPress websites. That could change. For now, I can recommend another tech professional who's a boss at WP.<br><br>

            We'll also use Google Analytics and Facebook for Developers to measure engagement. And then adjust in real time based on what the data says.<br><br>

            <strong>How do you handle payments and invoicing?</strong><br><br>

            Our working relationship begins with a start-up fee.<br><br>

            This will cover the creation of your landing and about page.<br><br>

            Optionally, we can set up a system to schedule appointments online.<br><br>

            We'll also agree to a certain content format and frequency, which will influence your total.<br><br>

            Options: short blogs, long-form articles, social media posts, and meta descriptions for SEO optimization.<br><br>

            The content marketing strategy will be tailored to fit your business goals. You'll be involved throughout the process.<br><br>

            After we complete every component of your Client Attraction Tower (CAT), you'll receive the option to sustain your progress long-term.<br><br>

            Invest in a monthly sustainability fee and you'll get to keep me on your team as long as you wish. Again, the fee depends on your unique situation.<br><br>
