With help from another developer, I created <a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/refresh-be/pull/35" target="_blank">scrubbers</a> to clean back-end data and make sure it's structured correctly. This <a href="https://refresh-app.netlify.com" target="_blank">landing page</a> is the most user friendly website I've ever designed. Plus I made responsive adjustments for desktop users and a <a href="https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1195141986778599425" target="_blank">Pomodoro Clock</a> that helps students work in short, focused bursts so they can be more efficient.</p>

                <p>Lambda Labs is the exact same thing as Build Week with one major difference: you devote two months to the project versus a single week. The previously discussed healthy habit app was made as a part of this program. Due to my theater background -- note: I've acted in 20+ plays, two short films, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Before-Fall-Ethan-Sharrett/dp/B0716H8PLB" target="_blank">one full length movie</a> -- I have strong presentation skills.

                <p>Bold statement, but it's true. During CS, I experienced a huge mental shift, and began writing comments as if the code might be used and built upon by a team of web developers. Due to this perspective, I began writing the most descriptive and detailed comments possible, which has also made a big difference in my ability to retain information. <a href="https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1219744338500050944" target="_blank">This tweet</a> reveals what I mean.</p>

                <p>The goal of CS was to gain an understanding of <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/Data-Structures/tree/daniel-wallen" target="_blank">data structures</a> such as <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/AlgoCasts/tree/master/exercises/stack" target="_blank">stacks</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/AlgoCasts/tree/master/exercises/queue" target="_blank">queues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/Graphs" target="_blank">graphs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/AlgoCasts/tree/master/exercises/linkedlist" target="_blank">linked lists</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/Hash-Tables" target="_blank">hash tables</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/AlgoCasts/tree/master/exercises/bst" target="_blank">binary search trees</a>.

                <p>In order to graduate CS, we had to create an <a href="https://github.com/WebWallen/Computer-Architecture/pull/1" target="_blank">emulator</a> that mimicked the everyday activities of a computer. Key components included RAM, CPU, registers, stack pointers, and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU). We also converted decimal numbers into their binary and hexadecimal equivalent. Now I'm focused on code challenges.

                <p>To be "Lambda School endorsed," students must achieve four goals. First, pass a behavioral interview about our personal philosophy and how that can be utilized effectively in a professional setting. Second, get through a technical interview that covers all the core code concepts we learned. Third, complete three of four problems in a code challenge hosted on HackerRank. Fourth, explain our solutions in a whiteboarding style interview. I wrote more about the endorsement process and what it taught me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/webwallen_lambdaschool-webdevelopment-react-activity-6649428300152258563-wxxb/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

                <p>Code challenges are not a natural talent. So I spent a lot of time practicing algorithmic problems in JavaScript after endorsement. I achieved my first <a href="https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1250207250968428544" target="_blank">long, unbroken streak</a> in April (30 days). Feel free to visit my <a href="https://app.codesignal.com/profile/webwallen" target="_blank">Code Signal profile</a>, where you'll see my record is 64 days with 128 code challenges solved.</p>

                <p>Animal rescue is my cause of choice. I don't spend much time worrying about other societal problems, because I'm too busy solving this one (see my reasoning <a href="https://www.tripets.org/resource/animal-rescue" target="_blank">here</a>). And I'm extremely effective at it. This website was a contributing factor in the adoption of 10+ kittens plus many more cats and dogs. It also helped my local animal shelter find foster homes for several pets and connect with new volunteers. Within two weeks, there were 1,500+ visitors (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/webwallen_animalrescue-animalrights-adoptdontshop-activity-6683462471203766272-GimJ" target="_blank">evidence</a>). Average time on page is over a minute and closer to three minutes for written content. See what all the fuss is about at <a href="https://www.tripets.org" target="_blank">Tri Pets</a>.</p>
