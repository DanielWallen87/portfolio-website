                <p>Build Week is a program where you work with other web developers from different cohorts. Typically your team includes a UI, front-end, and back-end developer. My task in this round was to develop a landing page. Here's the <a href="https://daniel-wallen.now.sh/" target="_blank">live site</a> plus the <a href="https://github.com/build-week-friend-finder/marketing/blob/build-week-friend-finder/daniel-wallen/README.md" target="_blank">repo</a>.</p>

                <p>A popular Twitter hashtag is #100DaysOfCode. From this day forward, I shared on a near daily basis. Sharing my work with others helped me build confidence in my skills.

With help from another developer, I created <a href="https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/refresh-be/pull/35" target="_blank">scrubbers</a> to clean back-end data and make sure it's structured correctly. This <a href="https://refresh-app.netlify.com" target="_blank">landing page</a> is the most user friendly website I've ever designed. Plus I made responsive adjustments for desktop users and a <a href="https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1195141986778599425" target="_blank">Pomodoro Clock</a> that helps students work in short, focused bursts so they can be more efficient.</p>

                <p>Lambda Labs is the exact same thing as Build Week with one major difference: you devote two months to the project versus a single week. The previously discussed healthy habit app was made as a part of this program. Due to my theater background -- note: I've acted in 20+ plays, two short films, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Before-Fall-Ethan-Sharrett/dp/B0716H8PLB" target="_blank">one full length movie</a> -- I have strong presentation skills. Thus, I decided to demonstrate the inner and outer workings of the Refresh healthy habit app discussed above. <a href="https://t.co/smzb3Nub6F?amp=1" target="_blank">Click here</a> to watch the video.</p>

The previous weekend, I made a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game that randomly selects the opponent (your CPU)'s movements. <a href="https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1216463404703125504" target="_blank">Here</a> is a brief code snippet and preview of the autogenerated output.</p>

                <p>Bold statement, but it's true. During Computer Science, I experienced a huge mental shift, and began writing comments as if the code might be used and built upon by a team of web developers. Due to this perspective, I began writing the most descriptive and detailed comments possible, which has also made a huge difference in my ability to retain information.
