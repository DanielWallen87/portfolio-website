        <h2>The Perfect Job Description</h2>
        <p>So I completed <a href="https://www.lambdaschool.com" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> recently and received their total endorsement. This means I passed a gauntlet of challenges including:
            <br><br>1. Technical Interview
            <br><br>2. Behavioral Interview
            <br><br>3. HackerRank Code Challenge<br><br>
        In addition, I've acculumated more than 2,000 hours of experience as a full stack web developer. 
            <br><br>This accounts for freeCodeCamp certifications completed and in process as a supplement to my already rigorous study plan.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>That Said, I Must Be Honest and Upfront</h2>
        <p>I've looked at job descriptions for software engineer roles. Most don't excite me. 
            <br><br>"Why?" you ask. Simple: I have a multifaceted skill set that includes strengths beyond development. 
            <br><br>Fast and easy way to see what I mean: visit <a href="https://www.tripets.org" target="_blank">Tri Pets</a> (pet adoption website I built and launched in a week for my hometown of Kingsport, TN). 
            <br><br>List of roles I performed:
            <br><br>-SEO
            <br><br>-Copywriter
            <br><br>-Photographer
            <br><br>-Web designer
            <br><br>-Web developer
            <br><br>-Community outreach
            <br><br>-Performance marketer<br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>Here's the Performance Metrics</h2>
        <img src="images/tripets_results.png" alt="Google Analyics for the pet adoption websites reflecting over 1,500 visitors in two weeks" /><br><br>
        <p>This was accomplished in one month with a mere 383 <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WebWallen" target="_blank">Facebook</a> friends and 350 <a href="https://www.twitter.com/WebWallen" target="_blank">Twitter</a> followers (read: I know how to find folks receptive to a marketing message).<br><br></p>
        <h2>At Last, We've Arrived to the Point</h2>
        <p>Since I have an unconventional but powerful skill set, I wrote my own perfect job description. Enjoy! And if there's room in your company for a Renaissance Man like me, feel free to reach out.<br><br></p>
