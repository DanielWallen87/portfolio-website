        <h1>Conversion Optimized Websites by <a href="https://danielwallen.dev" target="_blank">Daniel "Dogfather" Wallen</a></h1>
        <h2>Most web designers build your website and call it a day.</h2>
        <h3>That's not good enough. Watch the video to discover why. ðŸ‘‡</h3>
        <p class="center">Hard to see? Turn your phone sideways.</p><br><br>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n7Or7Lfy7g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <p class="center">
            <strong>COVID-19 took a toll on your service business. Let's address that.</strong><br><br>
            Pet service provider seeking a reliable system to find more customers?<br><br>
            Personal trainer or yoga teacher looking for a simple strategy to get more clients?<br><br>
            Counselor or therapist searching for an effective method to grow your private practice?<br><br>
            Sound familiar? This short video was made for you. Watch it before you scroll any further...<br><br>
            And yes, I can assist other types of service providers. But I'm focused on these niches for now!<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="below-video">Every conversion optimized website (COW) includes:</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Fun buttons that get clicked.</strong><br><br>
            If a button's text doesn't stir up an emotion, people won't click it (or learn more about you).<br><br>

            <strong>2. Friendly welcome message that feels natural.</strong><br><br>
            You only have <a href="https://www.sitepronews.com/2011/04/13/your-website-has-just-8-seconds/" target="_blank">eight seconds</a> to make a positive first impression. No pressure, I'll take care of it for you.<br><br>

            <strong>3. Helpful resource that your audience genuinely wants.</strong><br><br>
            Some people buy now. Others need time. For them, we'll make an email list (and a valuable report to give them).<br><br>

            <strong>4. Engaging about page that humanizes you in an authentic way.</strong><br><br>
            People don't buy services. They invest in service providers. Highlight what makes you unique to win hearts (and wallets).<br><br>

            <strong>5. Smooth opt-in procedure that ensures subscribers receive and open emails.</strong><br><br>
            80% of promotional emails aren't read. 80% of my welcome emails <u>are</u> read (<a href="https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1335969551985627136/" target="_blank">screenshot</a>). I'll do the same for you.<br><br>

            <strong>6. Personalized content that emphasizes a prospect's problems and pain points.</strong><br><br>
            Together, we'll create timeless (read: always relevant) content to promote your services over and over again.<br><br>
            
            <strong>7. Persuasive service descriptions that make your offer sound 100% awesome</strong>.<br><br>
            As a professional writer with a decade of experience, I can prescribe the ideal way to describe your services.<br><br>

            <strong>8. Attractive web design that wows people on any device or screen size.</strong><br><br>
            <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/smartphones-72percent-of-people-will-use-only-mobile-for-internet-by-2025.html" target="_blank">Half of your prospects</a> are on a smartphone. If your website isn't mobile friendly, they'll hate it and leave.<br><br>

            <strong>9. Targeted ads that reach people who are a good fit for your services.</strong><br><br>
            After your website is completely optimized, we'll grow your clientele at warp speed with Facebook ads.<br><br>  
            
            <strong>10. Community outreach templates that build brand awareness.</strong><br><br>
            Meanwhile, we'll tap into your network and start conversations that result in new clients.
