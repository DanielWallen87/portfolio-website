        <h1>Conversion Optimized Websites by <a href="https://danielwallen.dev" target="_blank">Daniel "Dogfather" Wallen</a></h1>
        <h2>Most web designers build your website and call it a day.</h2>
        <h3>That's not good enough. Watch the video to discover why. ðŸ‘‡</h3>
        <p>
            COVID-19 took a toll on your service business. Let's fix it.<br><br>
            Personal trainer looking to move your fitness business online?<br><br>
            Pet service provider seeking a reliable system to grow your customer base?<br><br>
            Mental health professional planning to supplement your income with a private practice?<br><br>
            This video was made for you. Watch it before you scroll any further.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="below-video">Every conversion optimized website (COW) includes:</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Fun buttons that generate clicks.</strong><br><br>
            If a button's text doesn't resonate with your audience, they won't click it (or see why you're the best at what you do).<br><br>

            <strong>2. Friendly welcome message that appeals to readers.</strong><br><br>
            You only have <a href="https://www.sitepronews.com/2011/04/13/your-website-has-just-8-seconds/" target="_blank">eight seconds</a> to make a strong first impression. I'll help you make it happen every time.<br><br>

            <strong>3. Helpful resource that's reserved for email subscribers.</strong><br><br>
            You must demonstrate your expertise to be seen as an authority. Plus it never hurts to have a list of qualified leads.<br><br>

            <strong>4. Engaging about page that humanizes you in a personable way.</strong><br><br>
            People don't buy services. They invest in service providers. Highlight what makes you unique to win hearts (and wallets).<br><br>

            <strong>5. Smooth opt-in procedure that ensures subscribers receive and open emails.</strong><br><br>
            80% of marketing emails are never read. 80% of my welcome emails <u>are</u> read (<a href="https://twitter.com/WebWallen/status/1335969551985627136/" target="_blank">screenshot</a>). I'll do the same for you.<br><br>

            <strong>6. Persuasive service descriptions that convince visitors to become clients.</strong>.<br><br>
            As a professional writer with a decade of experience, I can help you find the best way to phrase your services.<br><br>

            <strong>7. Attractive and responsive web design that wows people on any device.</strong><br><br>
            <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/smartphones-72percent-of-people-will-use-only-mobile-for-internet-by-2025.html" target="_blank">Half of your potential clients</a> are on a smartphone. If your website isn't mobile friendly, people will hate it and leave.<br><br>

            <strong>8. Personalized content that emphasizes a prospect's problems and pain points.</strong><br><br>
            Together, we'll create timeless content you can use to promote your services over and over again.<br><br>

            <strong>9. Targeted ads that multiply reach and allow your offer to scale.</strong><br><br>
            After your website is fully optimized, we'll use Facebook ads to grow your clientele with speed and precision.<br><br>

            <strong>10. Customized community outreach messages that can be used to validate a good fit (and if so, send them over).</strong><br><br>
            Meanwhile, I'll help you tap into your network and sell yourself (without seeming pushy or desperate).<br><br>
