        <h1>Find More Personal Training Clients in 2021 with a Slick Fitness Business Website</h1>
        <h2>Help people get fit, strong, and healthy at a greater scale than you ever dreamed possible.</h2>
        <h3>Meet Daniel Wallen, web designer specializing in personal trainer and yoga teacher websites. ðŸ‘‡</h3>
        <p class="center mobile">Want a bigger view? Turn your phone sideways.</p><br><br>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG0l8crrh2o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <p class="center">
            <strong>COVID-19 made personal training and yoga classes hard. Let's fix that.</strong><br><br>
            Are you ready to move your fitness business online?<br><br>
            Do you need a web design expert to eliminate the guesswork?<br><br>
            Would you like a website that generates new clients while you sleep?<br><br>
            If your muscles flexed in agreement, watch this video before you scroll...<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="below-video">Every personal trainer and yoga teacher website includes:</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Persuasive buttons that get clicked.</strong><br><br>
            "Learn More" persuades no one. "Yes, I Want to Lose Belly Fat" is clearly better. What do you think?<br><br>

            <strong>2. Engaging introduction that helps you stand out.</strong><br><br>
            People don't buy fitness training. They buy fitness trainers. Emphasize your individual personality to win.<br><br>

            <strong>3. Useful report that shows people how to train effectively.</strong><br><br>
            You can't expect every website visitor to buy immediately. We'll use a lead magnet to get emails for slow movers.<br><br>

            <strong>4. Actionable content that emphasizes your audience's fitness struggles.</strong><br><br>
            If you want new clients, you've gotta understand their unique quirks and personality. In time, they'll see you as an authority figure.<br><br>
            
            <strong>5. Vivid descriptions and sales pages that convince people to hire you.</strong><br><br>
            How are you superior to the average personal trainer? Why are your online yoga classes better than alternatives? We'll highlight your secret sauce.<br><br>

            <strong>6. Responsive web design that looks good on any device or screen size.</strong><br><br>
            50% of your potential clients are on a smartphone. If your website looks like crap on mobile, they'll close it and never come back.<br><br>

            <strong>7. Efficient systems that turn website visitors into paying clients.</strong><br><br>
            I'd never build a website and expect you to figure it out. We'll launch, promote, optimize, and monetize it together.<br><br>
            
        </p>

        <h3 id="below-video">Do you want a fitness business website your future yoga or personal training clients will love?</h3>
        <p>Click "Discovery Call" and we'll get to work.</p><br><br>

            <p class="faq-content">As a fitness professional, you understand progressive overload. I've trained my web design muscles for 2,000+ hours... that's a LOT of repetitions.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">How will we find more clients?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">We'll isolate the fitness goals that matter to your ideal client (and obstacles that get in their way) Then we'll publish and promote content that hits their pain points.</p>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">What else is involved?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Social media marketing is a big part of it. Step 1: Get your content to the right people. Step 2: Encourage them to book a consultation (automated appointment scheduling is included).</p>
