        <h1>Find More Personal Training or Yoga Clients in 2021 with a Fitness Business Website</h1>
        <h2>Help people get fit, strong, and healthy at a greater scale than you ever dreamed possible.</h2>
        <h3>Meet Daniel Wallen, web designer specializing in personal trainer and yoga teacher websites. ðŸ‘‡</h3>
        <p class="center mobile">Hard to see? Turn your phone sideways.</p><br><br>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n7Or7Lfy7g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <p class="center">
            <strong>COVID-19 made personal training and yoga classes hard. Let's fix that.</strong><br><br>
            Are you ready to move your fitness business online?<br><br>
            Do you need a web design expert to remove the guesswork?<br><br>
            Would you like a website that generates new clients at scale?<br><br>
            Any of this sound familiar? The short video above was made for you.<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="below-video">Every personal trainer and yoga teacher website includes:</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Persuasive buttons that get clicked.</strong><br><br>
            "Learn More" convinces no one. "Yes, I Want to Lose Belly Fat" is clearly better.<br><br>

            <strong>2. Engaging introduction that helps you stand out.</strong><br><br>
            People don't buy personal training. They buy personal trainers. Emphasize your unique personality to win.<br><br>

            <strong>3. Useful report that shows people how to train effectively.</strong><br><br>
            You can't expect every website visitor to buy immediately. We'll use a lead magnet to get emails for slow movers.<br><br>

            <strong>4. Actionable content that emphasizes your audience's fitness struggles.</strong><br><br>
            If you want new clients, you've gotta understand their personality. In time, they'll see you as an authority figure.<br><br>
            
            <strong>5. Detailed descriptions and sales pages that convince people to hire you.</strong><br><br>
            How are you superior to the average personal trainer? Why are your online yoga classes better than alternatives? We'll highlight your secret sauce.<br><br>

            <strong>6. Responsive web design that looks good on any device or screen size.</strong><br><br>
            50% of your potential clients are on a smartphone. If your website looks like crap on mobile, they'll close it and never come back.<br><br>

            <strong>7. Effective systems that turn website visitors into paying clients.</strong><br><br>
            I'd never build a website and expect you to figure it out. We'll launch, promote, optimize, and monetize it together.<br><br>
            
        </p>

        <h3 id="below-video">Do you want a fitness business website that your future yoga or personal training clients will love?</h3>
        <p>Click the "Discovery Call" link and we'll get to work soon.</p><br><br>

        <!-- <div class="faq">
            <button type="button" class="faq-button">What technologies do you use?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Websites are built and hosted with Webflow. We'll get a domain that fits your needs on Google Domains. Results are measured in Google Analytics. We'll adjust based on data.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Do you offer WordPress websites?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">No. WordPress websites are hard to optimize and easy to hack. 90% of websites that get hacked live on WP. More than 70% of WP themes are vulnerable to security breaches.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Why is Webflow a better choice?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Webflow's more secure and flexible. WordPress forces you to use pre-made themes, which are near impossible to customize. Webflow lets you start with a blank slate, so it's easier to optimize for your goals.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Will you build a website I can maintain?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">That's not ideal. Most people aren't qualified to manage their website. In the past, I was one of them. My website got hacked so hard I couldn't use it anymore. Want to take that risk? Fine. But I won't be a party to it.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">How is this web design service different from others?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Most web designers build your website. I build, launch, promote, optimize, and monetize your website. I also take care of boring stuff related to security and routine maintenance.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Who is a good fit for conversion optimized websites?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Service providers who work in fitness, pet care, or mental health. I can help other service businesses, but am focused on those niches for now.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Who isn't a good fit for conversion optimized websites?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">If you're not willing to engage with people on social media, this offer isn't for you. Community outreach is a huge part of the process.</p>
            <hr><br>

            <button type="button" class="faq-button">Are consultations done via phone or Zoom?</button>
            <p class="faq-content">Either is okay. We'll go with your preference. Scroll up and book an appointment now.</p>
