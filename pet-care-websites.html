        <h1>Get New Clients for Your Pet Care Services in 2021 with a Pawesome Website</h1>
        <h2>Connect with pet owners and make more money to do what you love (no anxiety required).</h2>
        <h3>Meet Daniel Wallen, web designer specializing in pet care service business websites. ðŸ‘‡</h3>
        <p class="center mobile">Too small? Turn your phone sideways.</p><br><br>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-ruCODNGEw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br><br>

        <p class="center">
            <strong>People's pets need you. Let's hecking connect with them.</strong><br><br>
            Dog trainer or groomer aiming to find more clients in the new year?<br><br>
            Pet sitter or photographer in need of a website that sells your services?<br><br>
            Would you like to help dogs and cats live their best life on a regular basis?<br><br>
            If your tail is wagging, this short video was made for you. Watch before you scroll...<br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="below-video">Every pet care service provider website includes:</h2>
        
        <p>
            <strong>1. Enthusiastic buttons that get clicked.</strong><br><br>
            "Learn More" is a snore. "Yes, I Love My Dog" begs to be clicked. Am I right?<br><br>

            <strong>2. Personable about page that builds trust.</strong><br><br>
            Pets are like children. People need to know their fur babies are safe in your care.<br><br>

            <strong>3. Helpful report that shows people how to be better pet parents.</strong><br><br>
            People love gifts. If the gift is great, they'll feel a need to reciprocate (read: buy your stuff).<br><br>

            <strong>4. Entertaining content that educates and amuses animal lovers.</strong><br><br>
            We'll create pawesome content that resonates with dog or cat people (and promote your services at the end).<br><br>
            
            <strong>5. Detailed descriptions that sell your pet services.</strong><br><br>
            Sales doesn't have to be sleazy. We'll phrase your services in a genuine way that speaks to responsible pet owners.<br><br>

            <strong>6. Fast website that looks great on any device.</strong><br><br>
            Site speed is a big deal. Mobile responsiveness is, too. Fail either test and Google penalizes you (not on my watch!).<br><br>

            <strong>7. Effective methods to generate new clients.</strong><br><br>
            You can't launch a website and pray for the best (unless you want to fail). We'll find clever ways to promote it repeatedly.<br><br>
            
        </p>
