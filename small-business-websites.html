		<h1>100% Personalized Web Design and Digital Marketing Services for Small Businesses Who Want to Win Big</h1>

        <h2>The Problem with Most Freelancers and Agencies</h2>
        <p>
            Your small business is totally unique. From far away, you might look similar to competitors in your industry.<br><br> 
            Upon closer inspection, your business has an intricate design unlike anything else the world has ever seen.<br><br>
            And yet the average freelance web designer or digital marketing agency sells every client the same service.<br><br>
            The lack of customization or research to uncover your specific needs is an insult. I don't play that game.<br><br>        
        </p>
        <img src="./images/kingsport-tn-web-designer.jpg" alt="Let's look under the hood and find the best fix for your small biz." />
        <h2>How Could I Recommend Any Service Without a Diagnosis?</h2>
        <p>
            Honest auto mechanics don't sell the same service to every customer.<br><br>
            They inspect your vehicle for safety hazards and recommend the most relevant repair.<br><br>
            Ethical doctors don't sell the same service to every patient. Could you imagine? That'd be a story.<br><br>
            Instead, they diagnose what's wrong and suggest a treatment designed to fit your individual situation.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Call Me Your Web Doctor and Social Media Mechanic</h2>
        <p>
            If your website is already proven to work, all you really need is targeted traffic (new customers).<br><br>
            If your website looks nice but isn't optimized, we can fix that with layout and copy modifications.<br><br>
            If your website is super outdated, it might be best to design a brand new one that is more reliable.<br><br>
            Together, we'll investigate and identify the fixes that will make the biggest impact for your business.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h2>I Can't Promise Fast and Easy Results (But I Can Promise Long Lasting Ones)</h2>
        <p>
            I live by the law of constant evolution. If you aren't growing, you're going backwards.<br><br>
            In other words, I measure the results of every website and online marketing campaign carefully.<br><br>
            And I won't stop revising until your conversion rate -- sales divided by traffic -- is as good as it gets.<br><br>
            Websites and advertising campaigns come with a month of revisions. I'm happy to manage them for you, too.<br><br> 
        </p>

        <h2>This Feels Like a Good Place to Introduce Myself</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! Daniel Wallen here. If you're tired of crappy Cardd and Squarespace sites, I'm your man.<br><br>
            Apperance isn't everything (but it sure makes a difference). I have metrics to prove it.<br><br>
            Even better, I won't sell a website that can't be monetized. How stupid is that?<br><br>
            If you're a small business owner who wants to win big, book a consultation. 👇<br><br>
