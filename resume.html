      <h1>My Top 3 Sharpest Strengths (and 3 Fun Facts)</h1>
      <div class="border">
        <h2>1. <a href="https://danielwallen.dev/web-development.html" target="_blank">Web Development</a></h2>
        <p>Eat. Sleep. Code. Repeat. As a full-time <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/courses/full-stack-web-development" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> student, this is my life. I code for 8-10 hours everyday. Imagine how much experience will accumulate in a year. So, why coding? I foresee a future where robots will replace human workers. Instead of resisting that reality (which would be futile), I'm learning to communicate with the scary machines.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="border">
        <h2>2. <a href="https://danielwallen.dev/content-marketing.html" target="_blank">Content Marketing</a></h2>
        <p>Tricky thing about writing online = many people want you to produce content that gets published in <em>their</em> name. Thus, I can't reveal the identity of past clients. But I <strong>can</strong> tell you they've been featured in major news and talk shows such as Today, 20/20, and Inside Edition. Also: I've written as more women than men (and no one seemed to notice).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="border">
        <h2>3. <a href="https://danielwallen.dev/social-media.html" target="_blank">Social Media</a></h2>
        <p>Since last September, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ive-walked-100-shelter-dogs-year-turned-me-better-human-daniel-wallen/ target="_blank">I've walked 100+ shelter dogs</a>. I also created Facebook posts about the animals and shared them on the shelter's page. Result: 70-80% of those dogs have a home. I've also managed FB pages for businesses and entrepreneurs, but that doesn't make me feel nearly as proud as the previous factoid. </p>

    <section id="history">
      <h1>Work History (and Reasons You Desperately Need Me)</h1> 
      <div class="border">
        <h2>1. Financial Services Rep (Appalachian Community Federal Credit Union)</h2>
        <p>My #1 responsibility = keeping IRA and CD account holders happy. The CEO trusted me to make deals with these members to keep their investments locked in. Often, I raised their interest rate in exchange for expanding their relationship with the credit union. For example: actions such as opening a credit card, establishing a direct deposit, and registering for online banking. This job taught me how to negotiate well.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="border">
        <h2>2. Office Manager (Bristol Family YMCA)</h2>
        <p>As a gymaholic, I enjoyed combining my interests in fitness and business. Fitness staff often picked my brain for marketing ideas. I also provided new members with tours of the facility and orientations in which I taught them how to use the equipment safely. My goal was to make a positive first impression so they felt welcome. This position showed me how to train people effectively.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="border">
        <h2>3. Freelance Writer (Many Different Clients, Most of Whom May Not Be Named)</h2>
        <p>I've written content for many different industries including: automotive, fitness, online marketing, and self-help/personal development. My articles have been read by millions and shared 500,000+ times. Feel free to browse my archives at <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/author/daniel-wallen-2" target="_blank">Lifehack</a> and <a href="https://pakwired.com/author/daniel/" target="_blank">Pakwired</a>, as that's where most of the content listed in my name lives. These opportunities sharpened my communication skills.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="border">
        <h2>4. Waiter (Piccadilly Cafeteria)</h2>
        <p>Seems out of place, right? Even so, I had fun. Why? It was an active and engaging job where I met people with a wide variety of personality types. Also, one of my biggest mantras is: "The way you do one thing is the way you do everything." If I can't even clean a restaurant to meet a manager's specifications, then how in the heck would I write code that exceeds your expectations? </p>
